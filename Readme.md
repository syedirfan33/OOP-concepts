Assignment Solution

Q-A.
1)
 a. There is no initial definition of Sing method in either Animal or Bird class. So code would have compilation error for the line bird.sing() in Main method. Defined a 'sing' method in package com.solution.a.one (Bird class)

 b. Not all the subclasses are required to have walk, sing or fly behaviour. In this case, Inheritance may not be the best solution for maintenance. we could take out fly and sing methods from Bird class and make separate classes for fly() and sing().This would enable only the birds that are supposed to fly or sing will extend the class.

2) Please refer to package com.solution.a.two

3) Please refer to package com.solution.a.three

4) Please refer to package com.solution.a.four
